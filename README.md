# **Mystery Chain**

A real-time, multiplayer story-building game where suspense and creativity collide.

Mystery Chain is a web app where players join a story room and take turns writing one line of a story. The catch? You can only see the *single last line* submitted. The full story remains a secret until the host ends the game, revealing the hilarious, bizarre, or epic tale you've all written together.

This project is built with React, Firebase for real-time data, and the Google Gemini API for an "Ask AI" feature.
